# PyChess

To run, use `PyChess_Interface.py`

Pychess was a fully text-based chess game in python. The text based version can still be played with no dependencies.

Text based version can be played locally using a single terminal, or over the network by configuring ip and port settings at the top of the main file.

2D interface runs on Pygame.
